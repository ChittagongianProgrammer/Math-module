# Basic Modules
This is my 2nd day of my attempt to do 100 days of code challenge. I am revising Python for software engineering purposes. I have attached two files to this repository.

## Basics.ipynb

This notebook covers basic Python data types and operations:

### It demonstrates:

- Integers, floats, strings, and booleans
- Print formatting with f-strings 
- Typecasting between types 
- Variable assignment shortcuts
- Basic math operators

It allows printing formatted messages showing use of different data types.

It would serve well as an introduction to Python basics - variables, primitives, operators for new programmers.

## math_modules.ipynb 

This notebook covers more advanced mathematical concepts: 

### It shows:

- Built-in math functions:
   - round, abs, pow, max, min
- Importing and using the math module
- Calculating circle properties like area and circumference 
- Special values like pi, e
- Square root and rounding functions
- Calculating hypotenuse of a triangle with Pythagoras  


It demonstrates important programming concepts:

- Importing modules
- Using external libraries for advanced features 
- Getting user input
- Mathematical operations

So in summary - Basics.ipynb covers Python basics, while math_modules.ipynb teaches more advanced math topics utilizing Python's math module.
